- Hello mortal.
- You give corruption far too much credit; evil does not inform good. It sullies it, like how the Babari sullied their world with violence, and that arrogant Goku sullied this sacred ground by swinging his fists at a god. Mortals received the divine gift of intellect, the potential for wisdom, but they misuse it to destroy the beauty of creation. Mortals do not succumb to evil, they are the evil. They create it and spread it with minds they shouldn't possess. How can we call ourselves gods if we watch this plight and do nothing to stop it?
- I look down on existence from a much higher perspective than you do. I witness this world, this universe, and the truth of all things. That yields deeper understanding. Wisdom. The realization that all mortals should be destroyed! The one and only mistake among all divine creations: that is what mortals are. And this mistake is egregious! To shape existence into the beautiful utopia it was always meant to be, the mistake must be corrected! I will purge all mortals from existence... in place of the gods WHO REFUSE TO ADMIT FAILURE!!
- Pronouns: Perfection/God/Justice
- Fun fact: I am beyond your understanding.
